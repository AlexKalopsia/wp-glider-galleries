# WP Glider Galleries

WP Glider Galleries is a simple WordPress plugin that replaces Jetpack slideshows and adds a block to create new [Glider.js](https://github.com/NickPiscitelli/Glider.js) galleries.

I used to have Jetpack running on my WordPress instance, but it became more and more bloated over the years. I decided to nuke it, but soon realized that I was making exctensive use of their `jetpack/slideshow` galleries. So instead of reinstalling it just for the sake of having the galleries, I've built this small plugin.
